# Message Generator Program

This is a message generator program that generates random messages each time it is run. The program utilizes JavaScript to create a randomized output consisting of at least three different pieces of data. You can customize the program to generate messages related to astrology, inspirational quotes, nonsensical jokes, or any other theme of your choice.

## Project Objectives

- Build a message generator program using JavaScript.
- Utilize Git version control to track changes and manage the project's codebase.
- Use the command line to execute and interact with the program.
- Develop the project locally on your computer.

## Prerequisites

To work on this project, you should have a basic understanding of the following:

- JavaScript: Familiarity with JavaScript syntax is required to build the message generator program.
- Git and GitHub: Knowledge of version control using Git and hosting repositories on GitHub will be beneficial for managing your project.
- Command line: You should be comfortable using the command line interface to run and interact with the program.

## Getting Started

To get started with the message generator program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub using the following command: git clone https://github.com/your-username/mixed_messages.git

   Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

2. Open the project directory on your local machine.

3. Customize the JavaScript code in the program to generate messages based on your preferred theme or data.

4. Save the changes and run the program using the command line: node message-generator.js

   Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

5. Each time you run the program, you should receive a new, randomized output.
